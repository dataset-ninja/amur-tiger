The authors have unveiled a pioneering large-scale dataset named **ATRW: Amur Tiger Re-identification in the Wild Dataset**. ATRW comprises over 8,000 video clips featuring 92 Amur tigers, each accompanied by bounding box annotations and tiger identity labels. Notably, unlike conventional re-identification datasets, these tigers are depicted in a wide array of unregulated poses and lighting scenarios.

## Motivation

Preserving wildlife is imperative for upholding species diversity. The failure to safeguard endangered species can disrupt ecosystems and adversely impact environmental well-being. This task increasingly relies on precisely monitoring the geographic distribution and population health of these endangered species, particularly in the face of threats like poaching and habitat loss. Conventional methods of outfitting wildlife with transmitters have drawbacks, including sensor malfunctions, limited scalability to large populations, and an inability to gauge wildlife interactions with their surroundings. Leveraging computer vision techniques offers a promising avenue for wildlife monitoring, especially through the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles or camera traps to gather visual data. Among these techniques, re-identification (re-ID) emerges as a crucial method for achieving accurate population assessments and tracking wildlife movement patterns. Notably, Amur Tigers are designated as an endangered species, with their population dwindling to fewer than 600 individuals.

<span style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;">Framework of Amur tiger re-ID system. Motion sensor triggers lightweight detector on smart camera to further filter non-tiger images. Tiger related images are fetched or uploaded to cloud services, which will run pose estimation and re-ID algorithm to produce tiger to camera association. As cameras are discrete placed in a conservation park, the authors could visualize the tiger moving trajectory on the park map
based on camera position information.</span>

However, the implementation of such systems faces several obstacles. Firstly, there are resource constraints on the edge camera, necessitating the need for low-power and precise tiger detection to activate image capture. This helps prevent the unnecessary capture of countless irrelevant images, which could otherwise consume storage space and drain battery life. Secondly, contemporary re-identification (re-ID) methods typically focus on pedestrians and cars as target objects. However, these objects typically exhibit limited pose variations within relatively confined environments. In contrast, wildlife data present a myriad of pose variations due to their unrestricted four-limbed movement, intricate natural backgrounds, and diverse lighting conditions. Thirdly, progress in addressing these challenges is hindered by the scarcity of datasets and benchmarks that extend beyond object types such as pedestrians and cars. These existing datasets often lack a systematic benchmarking protocol to evaluate end-to-end re-ID performance accurately. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop new datasets and benchmarks specifically tailored for studying wildlife re-identification in a systematic manner.

The authors introduced a groundbreaking large-scale dataset called the Amur Tiger Re-identification in the Wild (ATRW). Identifying individual Amur Tigers primarily relies on their distinctive body stripe patterns, which can undergo distortion due to the tiger's posture and movements. Manual corrections, while effective, are labor-intensive and impractical for wild environments. Automated correction methods entail identifying pose keypoints and potentially employing advanced modeling techniques to accommodate the non-rigid body deformations resulting from tiger movement. These innovative approaches not only address the challenges specific to Amur Tiger re-identification but also have broader applications in monitoring other wildlife species or objects reliant on deformable body patterns for identification.

## Dataset descrioption

The Amur tiger, also known as the Siberian tiger or Northeast-China tiger, constitutes a tiger population inhabiting the far east region, particularly the Russian Far East and Northeast China, with a global population of fewer than 600 individuals in the wild. Due to their extensive roaming range spanning hundreds of kilometers, capturing sufficient image data of free-roaming Amur tigers proves impractical. Instead, they obtained imagery of Amur tigers from multiple large wild zoos with the assistance of the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF). These images were acquired in uncontrolled environments using time-synchronized surveillance cameras and tripod-mounted SLR cameras. In total, the authors amassed 8,076 high-resolution (1920Ã—1080) video clips featuring at least one Amur tiger, which were subsequently uniformly sampled (one out of ten) into frames. Some frames were discarded due to motion artifacts, absence of tigers, or other forms of noise. The annotation process involved three key steps. Firstly, bounding boxes were annotated for each tiger, along with the tiger's view orientation in the image (frontal, left, right, back). Secondly, professionals identified the tiger's individual identity based on temporal and appearance cues. To ensure accuracy, tigers from different zoos were annotated separately. If a tiger couldn't be definitively identified, it was assigned an "unknown" identity and excluded from the re-identification process.

Similar to numerous other re-identification (re-ID) datasets, the authors have included a cropped dataset designed for isolated testing of re-ID algorithms, distinct from the wild environment. In this dataset, annotated images are cropped based on bounding boxes and subsequently renamed with identifiers including camera ID, shot ID, frame number, and entity ID. Here, the term "entity" refers to a combination of the tiger's identity and additional contextual information. Through expert consultations, it was determined that the tiger's stripe pattern serves as the most informative marker of its identity. Given that the left and right sides of Amur Tigers exhibit distinct stripe patterns, and capturing both sides of a tiger in the wild is rare, each side of the same tiger is treated as a separate entity for the purpose of identification.

The object detection module enables the system to specifically choose frames containing an Amur tiger, thereby minimizing storage, power, and networking usage. The authors' tiger detection dataset comprises 4,434 images containing a total of 9,496 bounding boxes. While some of these bounding boxes may indicate an 'unknown' tiger identity, as previously mentioned, these annotations remain valuable for training and evaluating object detection models.

Stripe information, as suggested by professionals, serves as the basis for tiger re-identification (re-ID), with the authors specifically focusing on images depicting the left and right sides of the tiger's body. Each side is considered a distinct entity, as previously mentioned. To assess re-ID algorithms, two evaluation settings are defined. Firstly, in the 'plain re-ID' setting, both query and database tigers are cropped and standardized using manually annotated bounding boxes and poses. Secondly, in the 'wild re-ID' setting, automatic tiger detection and pose estimation are employed to normalize tigers for subsequent re-ID analysis. The re-ID dataset comprises 182 entities representing 92 tigers, totaling 3,649 bounding boxes. Most entities are represented at least 10 times in the subset. Unlike the Market-1501 dataset for person re-ID, not all entities are observed across different cameras due to restrictions in capturing at certain wild zoos. To address this, the authors ensure that significantly different frames from the same camera are included in the dataset. As previously stated, an entity refers to a single side of a tiger and serves as the fundamental unit for re-ID analysis.
